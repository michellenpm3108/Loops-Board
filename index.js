// in JS you can store values in something called variable 
// when you DECLARE a variable, its name must be unique. 
// You can ASSIGN a VALUE to your VARIABLE. The value can be string, array or boolean
let age = 23 //value here is 23, variable is age
// variable can be varied, by grabbing the variable and assign it a new value
age = 24 

console.log(age);
